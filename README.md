# READMEs

It's important at this stage to point out that a good README.md file is essential.
If you submit your milestone projects without a README file, then they'll fail.
What should we put in a README.md file?
Well a good README.md file has a link to the live deployed project.
It helps the reader to understand what the project does, what technologies have been used, what features you'd like to add, and it also gives credit for any code that's been taken from other places such as libraries that you might have imported, or code you found on StackOverflow.
A detailed README.md file can really help the reader to get a feel for your project and your vision as a developer.
